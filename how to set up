To run this script on your Ubuntu 18.04 VPS, follow these steps:

1. Update and Install Required Packages
Before running the script, make sure your VPS has Python and the required packages installed.

Update the package list:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
Install Python 3 and pip (if not already installed):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
Install necessary libraries (e.g., cryptography, asyncio):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip3 install cryptography asyncio
2. Transfer the Python Script to VPS
You can use SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) to transfer your script from your local machine to the VPS:

From your local machine, run this command to transfer the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
scp "C:\Users\jacob\OneDrive\Desktop\ipv7 ip test 2.py" username@your_vps_ip:/home/username/
Replace username with your VPS username and your_vps_ip with the actual IP address of your VPS.

Alternatively, you can use FTP or a file manager like FileZilla to upload the script.

3. Run the Script on the VPS
Once the script is on the VPS:

Log into your VPS via SSH:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh username@your_vps_ip
Navigate to the directory where the script is stored (e.g., /home/username).

bash
Copy
Edit
cd /home/username
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 "ipv7 ip test 2.py"
This will start the server and client as defined in your script.

4. Firewall Configuration (Optional)
If your VPS has a firewall enabled (e.g., UFW), you might need to open the port (7777 in this case) to allow incoming UDP traffic:

Allow UDP on port 7777:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ufw allow 7777/udp
Check firewall status:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ufw status
5. Running in Background (Optional)
If you want to run the script in the background and keep it running after logging out, you can use screen or tmux.

Install screen (if not installed):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install screen
Start a new screen session:

bash
Copy
Edit
screen
Run your Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 "ipv7 ip test 2.py"
Detach from the screen session (press Ctrl+A followed by D).

You can later reattach to the screen session using:

bash
Copy
Edit
screen -r
6. Check Logs (Optional)
If the script is running as expected, you should see the logs for both the server and the client. You can view logs by checking the terminal output or redirecting the output to a log file.

For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 "ipv7 ip test 2.py" > server_log.txt 2>&1 &
This will run the script in the background and write the logs to server_log.txt.
